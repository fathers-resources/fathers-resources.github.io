	In "soft" sciences like sociology, it's much more difficult to detect
	manipulation of research, than in "hard" sciences like physics.  Soft
	science researchers who strive for objectivity deserve an extra
	measure of respect.  Sadly, far too many researchers are more
	concerned with pushing an agenda than with objectivity.  These same
	problems are not unknown in the world of journalism.
	Since the soft sciences and the media have a powerful influence on
	social policies in this country, this affects every family and every individual.

		A study of 18,761 heterosexual relationships, done by

	      <div class="article_description">
		A study of 18,761 heterosexual relationships, done by
		researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control,
		has found that women perpetrate 70% of non-reciprocal
		violence.  Only 30% of non-reciprocal violence was
		perpetrated by men.  And non-reciprocal violence
		accounted for only half of all cases.  Overall, the
		cases resulted in a significant number of injuries to
		men as well as to women.

		As of November 2007, N.H. Gov. John Lynch's

		were people who displayed no commitment to carrying
		out the duties of the commission as spelled out in its
		enabling legislation.  Furthermore, Gov. Lynch had
		solicited applications from these individuals rather
		than appoint any of the highly qualified individuals
		who had already submitted applications.
		<br>
		<br>
		In November 2007, this letter signed by professionals
		from all over the U.S. was sent to the governor and to
		members of N.H.'s Executive Council in the hope of
		encouraging the appointment of commissioners who would
		demonstrate committment to carrying out the
		commission's duties.
		<br>
		<br>
		In spite of this, a full year has passed, and
		Gov. Lynch has allowed a commissioner who has
		demonstrated hostility to the commission's mission to
		continue to sit on the commission even though his
		appointment expired more than a year ago.
