<p><strong>Tiny Little Authoritarians Licking Their Lips</strong><br />
Now, I understand that some public outings may cause a need for police or other rescue personnel to come out. Not good. </p>

<p>But if you're not doing an activity that might lead to your drowning in the ocean or requiring search teams to come out and traverse the forest...well, providing you aren't standing a few feet away from somebody else, breathing on them, do you really need policing? </p>

<p>Never discount the ability for the tiny little authoritarians to discover their raison d'etre -- reason for breathing air and goosestepping the planet -- in a crisis. </p>

<p>In Colorado, Rob Low <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/man-arrested-in-front-of-daughter-at-brighton-park-for-allegedly-violating-social-distancing/">writes</a> at KDVR that cops handcuffed a dad who'd been playing stickball in a park with his wife and daughter:  </p>

<blockquote>BRIGHTON, Colo. (KDVR) -- Matt Mooney feels Brighton police owe him a huge apology. The 33-year-old says he was handcuffed at Donelson Park in front of his 6-year-old daughter Sunday afternoon after police told him he violated the state's social distancing guidelines.  

<p>Mooney told the FOX31 Problem Solvers he refused to provide his identification to three police officers because he was confident he wasn't doing anything unlawful by playing tee-ball with his wife and daughter at the park.</p>

<p>"She's like, 'Daddy, I don't want you to get arrested.' At this point I'm thinking, 'There's no way they're going to arrest me, this is insane.' I'm telling her, 'Don't worry, Daddy's not going to get arrested. I've done nothing wrong. Don't worry about it,' and then they arrest me."</p>

<p>Former Brighton City Councilman Kirby Wallin recorded much of the incident on his cellphone, where you can hear his voice narrate the scene.</p>

<p>"He's being taken by the Brighton police for playing softball with his daughter in an empty park," Wallin said.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Problem Solvers, Wallin said, "I find it hard to believe with all the things going on in our communities, the only way to resolve a situation like this was to handcuff a father in front of his daughter."</p>

<p>The sign at Donelson Park said "Closed" but in smaller print reads, "in groups of no more than 4 persons, parks remain open for walking, hiking, biking, running and similar activities."</blockquote></p>

<p>Also, what occurred to Mooney occurred to me: Who's really violating "social distancing" guidelines? Authoritarian cops getting all up close and arrest-y with a citizen. </p>

<blockquote>"During the contact, none of the officers had masks on, none of them had gloves on, and they're in my face handcuffing me, they're touching me," he said.

<p>Mooney said he was released after spending about 10 minutes in the back of a patrol car but said he still deserved an apology.</blockquote></p> <div>

<p><strong>Advice Goddess Free Swim</strong><br />
A little wiped out from my writing day! </p>

<p>My document with my next book and columns crashed and wouldn't come back up. I have backups, but I didn't want to lose even a little of today's work -- plus I need my doc to open. </p>

<p>Luckily, the program is <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com">Scrivener</a>, greatest writing program, and only $49 (with 30 days free trial), plus they have been super to me when I've had the rare emergency. Rare because it's great fucking software. </p>

<p>Between the generosity of the Scrivener folks, who tweeted me a potential solution, and Gregg, who talked me through the next steps, all is well. However, the stress reduced my cognitive ability to around that of a houseplant. </p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>You pick the topics. </p>

<p>P.S. One link per comment or my spam filter will eat your post.</p> <div>

<p><strong>The Shrew Must Go On</strong><br />
Note the source of this woman's outrage: Her husband has not read her mind, did not do what she wanted, exactly as she'd have done it. Yet, she doesn't give him a chance to meet her needs -- by ASKING: "Hey, honey I'd love if you'd get 'multiple quotes,'" etc. </p>

<p>Joan of Suburban Arc. </p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>Christina Hoff Sommers tweeted: </p>

<blockquote>Someone sent me this as evidence of women's plight under patriarchy. To me, its evidence of a man being relentlessly bullied by his injustice-collecting wife. When he tries to defend himself, she accuses him of costing her too much "emotional labor."</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/">story</a>, from 2017: "Women Aren't Nags--We're Just Fed Up: Emotional labor is the unpaid job men still don't understand," by Gemma Hartley. An excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>For Mother's Day I asked for one thing: a house cleaning service. Bathrooms and floors specifically, windows if the extra expense was reasonable. The gift, for me, was not so much in the cleaning itself but the fact that for once I would not be in charge of the household office work. I would not have to make the calls, get multiple quotes, research and vet each service, arrange payment and schedule the appointment. The real gift I wanted was to be relieved of the emotional labor of a single task that had been nagging at the back of my mind. The clean house would simply be a bonus.

<p>My husband waited for me to change my mind to an "easier" gift than housecleaning, something he could one-click order on Amazon. Disappointed by my unwavering desire, the day before Mother's Day he called a single service, decided they were too expensive, and vowed to clean the bathrooms himself. He still gave me the choice, of course. He told me the high dollar amount of completing the cleaning services I requested (since I control the budget) and asked incredulously if I still wanted him to book it.</p>

<p>What I wanted was for him to ask friends on Facebook for a recommendation, call four or five more services, do the emotional labor I would have done if the job had fallen to me. I had wanted to hire out deep cleaning for a while, especially since my freelance work had picked up considerably. The reason I hadn't done it yet was part guilt over not doing my housework, and an even larger part of not wanting to deal with the work of hiring a service. I knew exactly how exhausting it was going to be. That's why I asked my husband to do it as a gift.</p>

<p>...In his mind, he was doing the thing I had most wanted--giving me sparkling bathrooms without having to do it myself. Which is why he was frustrated when I ungratefully passed by, not looking at his handiwork as I put away his shoes, shirt and socks that had been left on the floor. I stumbled over the box of gift wrap he had pulled off a high shelf two days earlier and left in the center of our closet. In order to put it back, I had to get a kitchen chair and drag it into our closet so I could reach the shelf where it belonged.</p>

<p>"All you have to do is ask me to put it back," he said, watching me struggle.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the box was in the way, that it needed to be put back. It would have been easy for him to just reach up and put it away, but instead he had stepped around it, willfully ignoring it for two days. It was up to me to tell him that he should put away something he got out in the first place.</p>

<p>"That's the point," I said, now in tears, "I don't want to have to ask."</blockquote></p>

<p>Grow the fuck up, princess.</p>

<p>Also, in general, men tend not to care as much that every. little. thing. is. in. its. place. Men without OCD, okay, I'll give you that. </p>

<blockquote>My husband is a good man, and a good feminist ally. I could tell, as I walked him through it, that he was trying to grasp what I was getting at. But he didn't. He said he'd try to do more cleaning around the house to help me out. He restated that all I ever needed to do was ask him for help, but therein lies the problem. I don't want to micromanage housework. I want a partner with equal initiative.</blockquote>

<p>And I want a unicorn and a flying car to garage next to it, but for now, Gregg will pick me up in his motor vehicle and take me places. (My car needed to go in my ongoing effort to stay housed instead of doing my writing from a tent under a freeway underpass.) </p>

<p>There's a really cool way I get him to do this taking me places thing, and it's TO ASK: For example, "Honey, would you please take me to the bank to put in my checks on Monday night?" </p>

<p>This saves him the trouble and, heh, <em>inventive labor</em> of creating a mind-reading helmet out of tinfoil and LED lights so he can telepathically ferret out my desires.</p> <div>

<p><strong>Dose Matters</strong> <br />
It's why masks and social distancing matter. </p>

<p>I told Gregg this and got him to start masking up while there was still (obscenely) word out there that masks were worthless. Non N95 masks aren't perfect, and even N95 masks don't provide perfect protection, because even skilled medical personnel may put them on incorrectly.</p>

<p>But maybe by wearing a mask you get a smaller shot of the virus if you're someplace where it's airborne.</p>

<p>This thinking is started to be echoed in various places. </p>

<p>Anne Hendershot <a href="https://spectator.org/coronavirus-dose-matters-in-the-demographics-of-death/">writes</a> in the American Spectator: </p>

<blockquote>According to a report in the New York Times by Joshua Rabinowitz, a professor of chemistry and genomics, and Caroline Bartman, a genomic researcher, the importance of viral dose is being overlooked in discussions of the coronavirus: "As with any other poison, viruses are usually more dangerous in larger amounts. Small initial exposures tend to lead to mild or asymptomatic infections while larger doses can be lethal."

<p>This has policy implications. Working in an office building that once had someone with the coronavirus in it is not as dangerous as dancing with a coronavirus infected person in the streets of New Orleans for Mardi Gras or on the beaches during Spring Break. And neither are as dangerous as spending time around severely ill Coronavirus patients in an ICU ward. This helps us understand why young healthcare workers -- without underlying conditions -- are falling ill with the virus. Many of them are dying.</p>

<p>In China, more than 3,300 health care workers were infected including Dr. Li Wenliang who died after being the first to alert the world to the pandemic. More than 4,800 health care workers have been infected in Italy and as New York City's hospitals become ever more impacted, several ER physicians and other healthcare workers are reported to be in critical condition -- some health care workers have died. We have to protect healthcare workers with whatever they need and it seems that we are finally doing that.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us, it is time to think about the policy implications of the fact that dose matters. It is possible to return to work at the end of our 30 day confinement -- but with proper precautions including masks, hand-washing, and appropriate social distancing. Medical personnel will always face extreme risk and need to be protected. But, for the rest of us, risk-reduction measures should suffice -- including mandatory mask-wearing in congested cities like New York City. Considering the fact that "dose matters" can make all the difference.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Civil Liberties Being Lifted Like A Bad Girl's Skirt</strong><br />
Anthony L. Fisher <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-new-yorkers-rhode-island-anti-american-civil-liberties-pandemic-2020-3">writes</a> at Biz Insider that the Rhode Island governor ordered the state police and National Guard to hunt for New Yorkers because of coronavirus fears. </p>

<p>There's surely more of this to come during the time of COVID.</p>

<blockquote> Rhode Island. Gov. Gina Raimondo was surely looking out for the best interests of her state's residents when she ordered a 14-day quarantine for anyone coming from New York coming into the Ocean State. Raimondo said that in her judgment this was "the most prudent form of action." 

<p>The State Police and the National Guard were deployed to enforce Raimondo's directive, resulting in surreal scenes of cars being pulled over and their passengers forced to register themselves with the government, simply because the vehicles were adorned with New York license plates. </p>

<p>Authorities with the power to detain and arrest US citizens were also sent to bus and train stations, as well as TF Green Airport, to seek out and inform visitors from New York of the order, the violation of which is punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and an incarceration of up to 90 days.</p>

<p>...Pandemic or no pandemic, the Fourth Amendment has something to say about that. </p>

<p>As Steven Brown, the Rhode Island ACLU executive director, put it in a statement: "While the Governor may have the power to suspend some state laws and regulations to address this medical emergency, she cannot suspend the Constitution."</p>

<p>Brown called the plan "ill-advised and unconstitutional" and added, "Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate simply does not, and cannot, constitute 'probable cause' to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be."</p>

<p>...Thankfully, Raimondo quickly backed off. </p>

<p>...But it's in times of crisis that civil liberties are the most vital.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the Constitution should be always considered inflexible, or that there aren't legitimate reasons for governments to take extreme measures. </p>

<p>...If the government says the only way to ensure public safety is the abandonment of civil liberties, we must always first ask if this is the only way. Because it usually isn't, and "emergency" powers have a funny way of surviving long after they've exhausted their intended use.</blockquote> </p>

<p>From the wonderful First Amendment lawyer, Marc Randazza, who defended me pro bono -- at great cost to himself and his firm -- when the TSA worker and her useless attempt at being a lawyer came after me for daring to use my free speech rights to complain about the TSA chickie's violation of my Fourth Amendment rights: </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In 2030, the vast majority of the people this shit saves will be dead of old age. The unrest, economic devastation, and rollback of civil liberties will be of dystopian proportions.</p>&mdash; Marc J.

<p><strong>Saluting Sheldon Adelson</strong><br />
Las Vegas Sands Corp. owner Sheldon Adelson <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/01/adelson-im-paying-all-my-workers-for-2-months-so-should-any-business-that-can/">writes</a> in the NY Post that he's paying all his workers for two months (and maybe more):</p>

<blockquote>Although the resort hotels of my company, Las Vegas Sands, are shuttered, I'm paying every one of our nearly 10,000 employees as though they were still working. We're even working to make up for lost tips. I hope to do that right up until the time that we can reopen our businesses.

<p>It's not only the right thing to do -- it's good business.</p>

<p>I've often said the story of my career would be a true rags-to-riches account, except for the fact that my parents couldn't even ­afford the rags. As the son of hard-working, low-income, immigrant parents, I grew up with the same anxiety people across the nation are feeling right now.</p>

<p>Where is the next meal coming from? How can I pay the rent and electricity bill? Families are desperate to know when they can go back to work.</p>

<p>I recall one of the most important lessons I learned from my father. He would come home from work -- when he could find work, that is -- and put loose change in the family pushke (charity box). When I asked why he would give to others when we had so little, he would say, "There is always someone whose need is greater than ours."</p>

<p>...We employers, especially larger ones, can do more. We should do more.</p>

<p>To my fellow corporate executives who are looking at spreadsheets and trying to ­determine the impact this crisis will have on sales and share prices, let me say: Our job as business leaders is now as simple as it is challenging. It is to maximize the number of employees and their families that we can help -- and help them for as long as possible.</p>

<p>America's corporations and small- and medium-sized businesses are making excruciating decisions. Many will result in people being out of work; millions have already been added to the jobless rolls as a result of the pandemic. Those difficult decisions, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses, could determine whether they are able to reopen when this crisis is resolved.</p>

<p>That is why protecting the ability of small and medium-sized businesses to recover is where government must again be responsive. Yes, more than $2 trillion in government rescue aid is coming. However, the longer this crisis continues, the greater the risk to the livelihood of many more Americans.</blockquote></p> <div>

<p><strong>Walking The (Ventilated) Walk</strong><br />
Amidst all the fear and scams and tragedy, there are stories of humans helping their fellow humans in big and small ways.</p>

<p>A story out of Israel by Shimon Cohen at <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/278120?fbclid=IwAR25558ERGj8omCPMCR-rj-YCUX-ZO39yhnt_YTjlDRlOcIIZLKNwBf2tQw">Israel National News</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Medtronic, the world's largest manufacturer of medical equipment, is currently receiving large amounts of attention for its ventilator. This week, the CEO of the company's Israel division, Yaron Yitzhari, made the decision to release all of Medtronic's patents for the production of ventilators, in order to enable any company wishing to manufacture them to use Medtronic's blueprints, for free.

<p>Arutz Sheva spoke with CEO Yitzhari, asking him about his decision and the possible repercussions for the company.</p>

<p>"We didn't just release the patents," he clarifies. "We've made available all the details of the manufacturing process, for anyone who's interested in manufacturing ventilators himself."</p>

<p>Wasn't he concerned about the potential loss of profit for his company, almost certain to run to the millions of dollars?</p>

<p>"In the present situation, I'm proud to work at Medtronic," he replies. "Our goal is to prolong lives - to save lives, in fact. </p>

<p>This is what's needed right now, in the emergency situation we're in, and this consideration comes before everything else. These are unusual times, and they demand of us to act in unusual ways. </p>

<p>So, when it comes to calculating the financial impact, it has negligible weight, because the main thing is saving lives, and that's what our company knows how to do."</blockquote></p>

<p>And then there are disappointing bits like this (the tweet I'm responding to): </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t understand this attitude. If there&#39;s no money in the coffers to pay rent, I understand people not paying rent.

<p><strong>LA Bureaucrats Act Fast To Corner The Market On Dumb</strong><br />
Just when you thought LA bureaucrats couldn't get dumber, couldn't act more counterproductively, there's this. Stores are crowded. Old people (especially) probably feel good going to restaurant they've patronized where they're well-treated to get groceries. </p>

<p>Nope. GO HOME, GRANDPA! </p>

<p>Oh, and restaurant desperately working to retool to stay in business, keep employees paid...well, fuck you, bros! Love, LA bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rest of us are dealing with all sorts of "new normals." </p>

<p>The story on the restaurant thing comes from Billy Binion at <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/31/los-angeles-bureaucrats-barbara-ferrer-shut-down-restaurants-for-selling-groceries-without-a-permit/">Reason</a>: </p>

<blockquote>A few Los Angeles restaurants struggling to maintain footing amid the COVID-19 outbreak identified a clever way to generate revenue while still serving the community: Start selling groceries.

<p>The city's public health department promptly shut them down. The reason? The small businesses don't have a "grocery permit."</p>

<p>"It's not really possible for a restaurant to become a grocery store," Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of Los Angeles County Public Health, said in a briefing yesterday. "You cannot just decide you want to sell groceries."</p>

<p>Why anyone can't do exactly that--exchange goods with those who want to purchase them--remains a mystery. Such licensing laws are typically put in place in the name of public safety, but one wonders how this decision could possibly help protect the public.</p>

<p>The restaurants-turned-grocery stores actually provide a rather obvious public health benefit. They are significantly less crowded than traditional grocery stores, which is convenient when considering that every major health organization has advised individuals to maintain a six-foot distance from surrounding passersby.</p>

<p>"Elderly people in the neighborhood really enjoy coming to Bacari PDR," says Robert Kronfli, the co-owner of one such restaurant-turned-grocery store. Foremost, "it was a super chill shopping environment," he says, with "only one or two people in there at once." Contrast that with the major chains, which have been overwhelmed with an onslaught of patrons. "They're afraid to go to large supermarkets right now because of the lines and because of the social distancing thing."</p>

<p>A local health inspector shuttered Bacari on Friday morning, citing the establishment's lack of a license.</blockquote></p>

<p>What does Bacari have? Well, just " toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies--the very items that notoriously disappeared from shelves weeks ago when fears started to spread around COVID-19." And produce.</p>

<p>I guess it's better to let it rot, rather than letting grownass adults make choices about where they shop and who they trade money for goods with.  </p>

<p><strong>The Answer Is "I Just Don't Know." And Nobody Does.</strong><br />
I'm deeply concerned about the pandemic's effects on business, including my own. (I also deeply resent the way the President, the CDC, and others were unprepared for this pandemic.) </p>

<p>But I'm likewise deeply concerned about people's lives, including the lives of healthcare workers.</p>

<p>So I'm staying in, and using gloves, and when I need to go to the bank, I'll wear them to use the touch screen. I'll also have a mask on hand, though I don't plan to get near anyone.</p>

<p>Turns out that there is -- or at least is perceived to be -- a divide in who's living cautiously and who's going about their business a good deal like before.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/social-distancing-culture/609019/?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email">The Atlantic</a>, McKay Coppins has a piece titled:</p>

<blockquote>The Social-Distancing Culture War Has Begun: Across the country, social distancing is morphing from a public-health to political act. The consequences could be disastrous.</blockquote>

<p>A bit from his piece: </p>

<blockquote>For a brief moment earlier this month, it seemed as if social distancing might be the one new part of American life that wasn't polarized along party lines. Schools were closed in red states and blue; people across the political spectrum retreated into their home. Though President Donald Trump had played down the pandemic at first, he was starting to take the threat more seriously--and his media allies followed suit. Reminders to wash your hands and avoid crowds became commonplace on both Fox News and MSNBC. Those who chose to ignore this guidance--the spring-breakers clogging beaches, the revelers on Bourbon Street--appeared to do so for apolitical reasons. For the most part, it seemed, everyone was on the same page.

<p>The consensus didn't last long. Trump, having apparently grown impatient with all the quarantines and lockdowns, began last week to call for a quick return to business as usual. "we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself," he tweeted, in characteristic caps lock. Speaking to Fox News, he added that he would "love" to see businesses and churches reopened by Easter. Though Trump would later walk them back, the comments set off a familiar sequence--a Democratic backlash, a pile-on in the press, and a rush in MAGA-world to defend the president. As the coronavirus now emerges as another front in the culture war, social distancing has come to be viewed in some quarters as a political act--a way to signal which side you're on.</p>

<p>...Some of the more brazen departures from public-health consensus have carried a whiff of right-wing performance art. Jerry Falwell Jr., an outspoken Trump ally and president of the evangelical Liberty University, made headlines this week for inviting students back to campus over objections from local officials. The conservative website The Federalist published a trollish piece proposing "chicken-pox parties" as a model for strategically spreading the coronavirus. Throughout the conservative media, calls to reopen the economy--even if it means sacrificing the sick and elderly--are gaining traction.</p>

<p>"I would rather die than kill the country," Glenn Beck declared on his radio show.</p>

<p>...Of course, not everyone who flouts social distancing is making a political statement. Many have to work because they can't afford not to; others are acting out of ignorance or wishful thinking. Beyond personal behavior, there is a legitimate debate to be had about how to balance economic demands while combatting a global pandemic.</p>

<p>Still, the polarization around public health seems to be accelerating: In recent days, Republican governors in Alabama and Mississippi have resisted calls to enact more forceful mitigation policies. Polling data suggest that Republicans throughout the U.S. are much less concerned about the coronavirus than Democrats are. According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, Trump won 23 of the 25 states where people have reduced personal travel the least.</blockquote></p>

<p>I'm also aware that people are not monolithic. I see plenty of Republicans on social media expressing deep concern for healthcare workers and others, as well as the need to wear masks and gloves and do "social distancing."</p>

<p>By the way, I -- a person who's politically independent, a libertarian, not a D or an R -- see it as unreasonably authoritarian to tell people they can't go outside instead of telling them in persuasive ways why they need to maintain social distancing outdoors. (Am I being unrealistic?)</p>

<p>Is this perceived political divide for real? Is it more virtue signaling than anything else? Or does it reflect a pernicious political confirmation bias with serious long-term consequences?</p> <div>

<p><strong>State Pols Hungry For Martial Law Or At Least Federal Nanny State-ing</strong><br />
Nothing like a crisis to bring out the tiny little authoritarians and those who long for authoritarian control. It's especially disgusting when people elected to be in charge wilt like lilies and beg for the Feds to come in with an iron fist. </p>

<p>Jonathan Turley <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/489968-governors-should-focus-on-tackling-coronavirus-rather-than-shift-blame">writes</a> at The Hill: </p>

<blockquote>It is the legal version of panic shopping. Politicians and commentators seem to long for federal takeovers, if not martial law. </blockquote>

<p>For example: </p>

<blockquote>Mayor Bill de Blasio has demanded federal troops be deployed to New York City and wants the nationalization of whole industries. Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois has demanded that President Trump take charge and lamented that "precious months" were wasted waiting for federal action. Internet critics are even more direct in demanding a federal takeover, including a national quarantine.

<p>...They are buying into far more than they need while not doing as much as they could with what they have. For decades, governors fought to retain principal authority over public emergencies but did little with that authority. While many are doing impressive work now, some governors and mayors seem as eager to contain the blame as the virus. Call it "political distancing."</p>

<p>Even if Trump were inclined to fully nationalize the crisis -- deploy troops, force manufacturers to produce ventilators, impose price controls -- our Constitution expressly leaves most police powers and public health protection to the states in our system of federalism. The Framers believed liberties and powers were safest when held closest to citizens in local and state governments. Locally elected officials are more readily held accountable than unknown Washington bureaucrats. Of course, with authority comes responsibility -- and the latter is not always as welcomed as the former.</p>

<p>Despite all the hyperbole of the last few days, the president's authority to act is far more limited than many seem to think. Trump can't -- and shouldn't -- just "take over." For example, while he may want to "open for business" by Easter, he has no clear authority to lift state orders for citizens to stay at home. His greatest authority is supplying assistance for states in the production and delivery of needed resources like ventilators. While he can put conditions on some assistance, he cannot commandeer states' authority in their responses to the pandemic.</p>

<p>...States remain in the best position to address emergencies, and these earlier laws gave governors ample authority to act. They simply did relatively little in the intervening two decades to prepare for public health emergencies. A report from a New York Department of Health task force in 2015 has resurfaced, warning that New York could face a ventilator shortage of roughly 15,000 in any new pandemic. While the report did not call for stockpiling, states clearly have not done enough, individually or collectively, to set aside such resources.</p>

<p>Media coverage has referred to the National Emergency Act and other impressive statutory titles to suggest that the president can order national quarantines and take over management of this crisis. In fact, these laws follow the same model laid out by the Constitution's Framers in leaving the responses to state control. For example, the oft-referenced Stafford Act merely heightens the authority of federal technical, financial, logistical and other assistance to state and local governments.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Defense Production Act is meant to help advance priorities, not establish a nationalized industrial base. If companies already agree to expand production, or to retool for new products, there is no need to impose mandates under the act; that process will not likely go any faster. Nationalization can slow rather than speed relief in an emergency by replacing existing personnel and systems. With large purchase orders and indemnifications, executives have ample incentive to expand production. After General Motors failed to meet expectations on price and production, Trump triggered the act, and that is precisely how it should be handled.</blockquote></p> <div>

<p><strong>The Progressive Fantasy Of Why People Are Homeless Is Making Homelessness Worse</strong><br />
Edward Ring concisely lays out what I learned from <a href="http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2020/02/beloved-myths-a.html">Manhattan Institute scholar Christopher Rufo</a> recently. </p>

<p>Ring <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/while-venice-beach-residents-under-lockdown-homeless-and-encampments-grow-and-thrive/?fbclid=IwAR2EiOmZ7oc4_MQhPGGIy6c0kZrodRu_PLe7-JdztpeykvaSBwjmm-anMVE">writes</a> at California Globe that while law-abiding Venice residents (like me) have effectively "been under house arrest for over a week ...  in the homeless haven known as Venice Beach, the party hasn't skipped a beat."</p>

<blockquote>Whatever minimal law enforcement still existed in Venice Beach prior to the COVID-19 outbreak has diminished further, and more tents than ever have appeared on the boardwalk and along the streets.

<p>It's important to recognize that some of California's homeless are victims of circumstances beyond their control, who want to work, who have to care for young children, who stay sober, who obey the laws. But not sufficiently acknowledged by agenda driven politicians and compassionate care bureaucrats is the fact that most of these truly "homeless" find shelter.</p>

<p>The vast majority of homeless that remain unsheltered, especially in places like Venice Beach, are either drug addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill, or criminals. None of these people belong on the streets, not now, and not ever. There is not a homeless crisis or housing crisis in Venice Beach so much as a drug crisis, an alcoholism crisis, a mental health crisis, and a breakdown of law and order.</p>

<p>Stories about what has been happening in Venice Beach are endless and chilling:</p>

<blockquote>A man swinging an ax in the middle of an ally who cannot be arrested because he isn't breaking any laws;

<p>A gang of youths disassembling literally stacks of high-end bicycles in front of their tents, but this isn't a chop-shop because there is no proof;</p>

<p>Other youths who've clambered onto the roof of a church to engage in loud drunken revelry all night long, later willing to vandalize the homes of residents they suspect of calling the police;</p>

<p>Human and canine feces everywhere; bottles of urine sitting on street curbs;<br />
discarded syringes; rats multiplying like, rats, getting fat on garbage and food scraps piling up around tents;</blockquote></p>

<p>And it still goes on and still goes on and still goes on. Virus? What virus?</p>

<p>Nothing that California's state and local policymakers have done to-date have been effective in combating these crises, because their approach has been what they refer to as "housing first," a policy that prioritizes providing housing prior to addressing behavioral issues. "Housing first" is a boondoggle, rewarding politically connected members of the Homeless Industrial Complex. It will never solve the problem, even if for no other reason, then because of the astronomical costs.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>The Replacement Religion For Wealthy Elites</strong><br />
Ed West <a href="https://unherd.com/thepost/i-miss-the-culture-warriors/">writes</a> at Unherd:</p>

<blockquote>It was the upper-middle-class who became radicalised during the 2010s, not the poor, with progressivism partly becoming a replacement religion but also reflecting the fact that upper-class wealth relied on globalisation. The culture wars that flared up were essentially the product of wealthy people in a wealthy society with no real, existential problems.

<p>The real dark side of this "great awokening" was that, while woke capital lectured us on how progressive they were, they did so on the back of near-slave labour in China; while young western liberals convinced themselves that their countries were on the verge of fascism -- when they were in fact becoming more liberal than ever by almost every measure -- they were tweeting on devices made in a state where Muslims are put in concentration camps.</p>

<p>Political activists are the white blood cells of a country, and when society faces no real threats, they turn in on society itself, ripping up its institutions in a desperate attempt to rid them of non-existent dangers. And so social problems had to be essentially imagined and invented, and there were plenty of journalists and activists willing to imagine them.</p>

<p>Now society faces an actual threat, and meanwhile our devil's alliance with China has been irreparably damaged, it all seems so dated. Don't these people know that it's 2020?</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Morons In Charge</strong><br />
Christian Britschgi <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/25/new-york-legislators-introduce-bill-to-cancel-rent-for-90-days-for-workers-affected-by-coronavirus-closures/">writes</a> at Reason that New York legislators have introduced a bill to cancel rent for 90 days for tenants affected by coronavirus closures. </p>

<p>This, to me, reflects the hatred some have for people who have built a business, own something of value, have money. It also suggests an inability to think thoughts -- come to conclusions down the line -- of the slightest complexity. </p>

<p>Britschgi helps them out with the first line in this excerpt of his piece. And he's also right about the solution -- which, no, is not suspending mortgage payments, too, which also comes with downstream consequences:</p>

<blockquote>Building owners ... argue that they too have bills that don't go away just because a tenant is out of work.

<p>Suspending both rent and mortgage payments, however, just shifts these costs further down the line to banks and financial institutions who lent to landlords. If the return on their real estate investments goes to zero, lenders could also be in trouble.</p>

<p>Shifting costs from one interest group to another doesn't eliminate costs, it just changes who ends up bearing them. The rent freeze being proposed is a risky game of hot potato.</p>

<p>There's obviously a public health rationale for keeping people in their homes right now, particularly in New York City, which is experiencing the most severe COVID-19 outbreak in the country. There's also a sound case that the government should compensate people it puts out of work.</p>

<p>The best way to do that, however, would be through federal income assistance that allows everyone to continue to pay their bills. Cash assistance has the added benefit of transparency, as the costs of these closures will be on budget for everyone to see. Eviction moratoriums and rent cancelations, however, are more opaque, overly complex, and could create problems down the road.</blockquote></p>

<p>And while we're on the subject of dribbling moronhood: </p>

<p><strong>Pronoun Authoritarianism</strong><br />
This screenshot in the tweet below is a page from a dear friend of mine's new book. He's Scott Barry Kaufman,and he tries very hard to be kind and to be a force for good.</p>

<p>The book is <a href="https://amzn.to/2Jc8xwL">Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization</a>. In it, he writes, "I tackle common human themes such as security, connection, love, exploration, purpose, and peak experiences."</p>

<p>Here's an exchange he had with another social psychologist, Eli Finkel. (I've referenced both Scott's work and Finkel's in my column.) This post isn't about what Scott says but about the taken-for-granted assumptions about one's "pronouns."</p>

<p>By the way, if you ask me to call you by a certain name or speak to you using a certain pronoun, I will. It's the kind and respectful thing to do.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll do you one better. Let me know if you think it&#39;s fair. I put a lot of thought into it, perhaps too much thought. <a href="https://t.co/hs90SP7nbw">pic.twitter.com/hs90SP7nbw</a></p>&mdash; Scott Barry Kaufman (SBK) (@sbkaufman) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbkaufman/status/1242536412898922496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Personally, I'm disturbed by the whole notion that we "include" people through calling them the right pronoun, which requires all this "homework" about a person before you say one word to them. </p>

<p>This new requirement for doing this seems to be a sort of religion that allows people to have power over others -- to push them around and deem them thought and speech criminals, even if they simply forget to use somebody's requested "pronoun."</p>

<p>This also seems to be a way for people to feel special without earning it -- to require people to find out all sorts of information about them, on penalty of being accused of a thought or speech crime and then cancelled.</p>

<p>It seems outrageous to me that some stranger would be required to prep for conversation by investigating my history -- that my family are Eastern European Jews, that old friends call me "Flamey" or "Flame-o," that I eat keto, that I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah -- and that they would be seen as disrespectful and even bigoted for failing to find out all the ways I'm (heh) unique and special.</p>

<p>But that's what we're requiring people to do with this notion that we have to ask "what is your preferred pronoun?" </p>

<p>And again, this is done now with threats embedded -- with the threat that you will lose your job and be deemed a bigot if you don't make this "What's your pronoun?" business a priority.</p>

<p>Oh, and I will be very clear on this again: If you want me to call you "zhe" or "they" or "lemon pie with a slight dusting of confectioner's sugar on top," I will do my best to remember that and do it, because it's kind.</p>

<p>But I think the considerations above are important, and I think it's too easy to just accept the demand to ask people for their "pronouns" as a requirement for being considered decent -- with the possible penalty of losing everything as the penalty for failing in some way, even by forgetting.</p> <div>

<p><strong>Again: Games! Plus Goggles, Gloves, And Masks</strong><br />
I am not a kid person. If I had children in my house for a week, I'd eat them.</p>

<p>If that's not an option for you, perhaps some <a href="https://amzn.to/398i02F">best-selling toys and game</a>s from Amazon would be helpful! Or a Fire Stick streaming device or a tablet for your kids. Same link.</p>

<p><em>And my post from the other day: </em></p>

<p>A trip to the grocery store should not be deadly or make you and/or your loved ones sick. </p>

<p>Protection against coronavirus: <a href="https://amzn.to/2PTuW5J">Comfortable disposable gloves that work with touch screens</a> -- I have been wearing the Saloncare brand at the top. I know <em>they</em> work with touch screens. Get a small enough size and you really won't notice they're on. I got small; Gregg got extra-large. 100 per box. </p>

<p>If those aren't available, try <a href="https://amzn.to/3bkaiE2">these</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2WziTPo">Goggles</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/2vEIsTX">These</a> seem good -- and aren't expensive. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3a96rKb">Masks</a>. I am of the mind that something is better than nothing, and you can put a cut-out bit of a vacuum cleaner bag inside yours to make it block tiny coronavirus particles.</p>

<p>These take a while to come but are better than nothing if things get worse or remain the same. Gregg and I have the gloves and I asked him this morning to order masks and goggles. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3djE7qf">Vitamin D</a> also seems <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/70/7/617">important</a> to take. I take 5,000 iu, which leaves my level at about 50, very good but not too high, but I don't go outside really, so maybe I need more than you do. You should ideally get your level tested, but for now, at least 1,000 iu seems like it might be a good idea. From what I've read, most people are low in D. </p>

<p>Also <a href="https://amzn.to/2vI6fT6">zinc glycinate</a> -- the best kind per the host of shitty studies out there that I read in the middle of the night a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>PS My "science-help" book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2fFdl2c">"Unf*ckology: A Field Guide to Living with Guts and Confidence," </a>makes a great gift. It's highly practical book (and darkly funny, too) about the <em>actions</em> to take to transform yourself.</p>

<p>A thing I recommend as a gift -- possibly a gift for yourself!</p>

<blockquote>It's this <a href="https://amzn.to/2SXCSlV">incredible snail face cream</a> I've been using -- a Seoul-aceutical. Of course, being me, it's the $16ish version of the $80 or $90 cream everybody else wears, but with the same active ingredients in the same amount. And in a nice jar, too, and not a tiny one, either! 

<p>Makes my skin feel like velvet, and people I haven't seen for a while keep saying, "How come your face has no lines?" Okay, French sunblock is part of it, but this stuff seems to do something that fills out your skin in a nice way and disappears some of the big ridges you'd otherwise have when you are no longer 22! </blockquote></p> <div>

<p><strong>Will The Trump Presidency Get Killed By His Response To Coronavirus?</strong><br />
Andrew Malcolm is not exactly a lefty. (He worked in the Bush White House as Press Sec for Laura Bush and was deputy communications manager from 1999-2001 for the Bush presidential campaign.)</p>

<p>He has a <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article241454306.html">column</a> up on Trump's recent low blows. The scene here is a White House press conference: </p>

<blockquote>The president called on Peter Alexander, a reporter from NBC, the network that branded Trump as a national celebrity with 14 years as a prime-time reality TV host.

<p>This is a free country. In such settings, journalists should be allowed to ask any question at all, knowing they will in turn be judged on its quality or hostile stupidity.</p>

<p>Alexander began by asking about Trump's effusive recent praise for an unproven drug, then delivered an open-ended query most politicians can only dream of: "What do you say to Americans who are scared?" That's a perfectly legitimate question and an invitation to say anything he wants.</p>

<p>"I know Americans are scared. None of us have ever been through a pandemic like this as a nation. But we are a sturdy, resilient people. Americans can know that my administration and the respected experts here plus thousands of others across the country are working night and day to design an answer for this new virus, and as quickly as possible, a vaccine to prevent its return."</p>

<p>Trump could have said something like that. He didn't. Instead of a perfect opportunity to hail the earnest efforts of himself, Pence and experts, Trump lit into the reporter, calling it "a nasty question."</p>

<p>"I say you are a terrible reporter," Trump replied. "That's what I say." He added, "You're doing sensationalism. And the same with NBC and Comcast. I don't call it Comcast. I call it 'Con-Cast.'"</p>

<p>Media bashing is a go-to part of Trump's rhetorical repertoire. His solid base likely loves it, as they've liked the economy, millions of new jobs, tax cuts and soaring stock markets under Trump. But the virus and its accompanying shutdowns place all of that at risk now.</p>

<p>Trump fans like his fighting spirit. But this time, he blew a perfect chance to boast, accurately, choosing to punch when there was nothing to counter.</p>

<p>Then, at last Sunday's briefing, the subject of Sen. Mitt Romney in virus isolation came up. "Geeee," said the fellow Republican with gratuitous sarcasm, "that's too bad." Trump can't seem to help himself.</blockquote></p>

<p>How likely do you think it it is that this will "help" him out of office -- rather than being granted another term?</p>
