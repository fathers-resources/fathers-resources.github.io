<p class="paragraph">  (b) the testator makes or acknowledges the signature in the presence of two or more attesting witnesses present at the same time; and</p>

<p class="headnote">Where certificate not available</p> 
<p class="subsection">(3) For the purposes of this section, if a certificate under subsection (2) is not available, a member of a naval, land or air force is deemed to be on active service after he or she has taken steps under the orders of a superior officer preparatory to serving with or being attached to or seconded to a component of such a force that has been placed on active service.  R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26, s. 5.</p>

<p class="headnote">Position of signature</p> 
<p class="section"><a name="BK9"></a><b>7</b> (1) In so far as the position of the signature is concerned, a will, whether holograph or not, is valid if the signature of the testator made either by him or her or the person signing for him or her is placed at, after, following, under or beside or opposite to the end of the will so that it is apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by the signature to the writing signed as his or her will.</p> 
<p class="headnote">Idem</p> 
<p class="subsection">(2) A will is not rendered invalid by the circumstance that,</p> 
<p class="paragraph">  (a) the signature does not follow or is not immediately after the end of the will;</p> 
<p class="paragraph">  (b) a blank space intervenes between the concluding words of the will and the signature;</p>

<p class="paragraph">  (e) there appears to be sufficient space on or at the bottom of the preceding side, page or other portion of the same paper on which the will is written to contain the signature.</p> 
<p class="headnote">Idem</p> 
<p class="subsection">(3) The generality of subsection (1) is not restricted by the enumeration of circumstances set out in subsection (2), but a signature in conformity with section 4, 5 or 6 or this section does not give effect to,</p> 
<p class="paragraph">  (a) a disposition or direction that is underneath the signature or that follows the signature; or</p> 
<p class="paragraph">  (b) a disposition or direction inserted after the signature was made.  R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26, s. 7.</p>
