Yes, New York, You Do Have No-Fault Divorce</span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div><h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size:100%;">Lately, all kinds of journalists have been repeating the mantra that "New York doesn't have no-fault divorce", as in <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_5358469,00.html">this story about the Gest-Minelli divorce.</a> It's one of those things that everyone seems to believe, but which just ain't so. New York has no-fault divorce the way it was originally proposed -- based on the mutual decision of consenting adults. New York's no-fault ground is the first in this list of divorce grounds:<br /></span></h2> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size:100%;">Grounds for Divorce in New York</span></h2>   - living apart for one year pursuant to separation decree, judgment or written agreement, with satisfactory proof of substantial performance of same.<br /> - cruel or inhuman treatment (such that defendant's conduct so endangers plaintiff's physical or mental well-being as to render cohabitation unsafe or improper)<br /> - abandonment by defendant for one year<br /> - imprisonment of defendant for three consecutive years after marriage<br /> - adultery by defendant<br /> Code: Domestic Relations Law, § 170<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Utah enacts divorce prevention / trial separation package</span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://le.utah.gov/%7E2007/bills/hbillenr/hb0128.htm">Text of the legislation, as enacted</a><br /><br />In March, 2007, Utah legislator Lorie Fowlke wrote to Smart Marriages:<br /><br />I am an attorney and Utah state legislator, and attended your conference last year in Atlanta. I just passed the nation's first divorce orientation legislation, HB 128 and it has been funded! This bill is in addition to the already required 2 hour divorce education class for parents. The divorce orientation class is to help them understand the impacts of divorce, provide resources for strengthening their marriage, and resources to go through the divorce and deal with post-divorce issues with less pain, if they proceed. It also allows couples to file for a temporary separation, WITHOUT filing for divorce, for up to one year. During the separation, they must take the course. If they proceed with the divorce, the relatively small filing fee for the temporary separation is applied to the divorce filing fee. It passed the HOUSE unanimously and the Senate with only one dissenting vote. The court administrator's office is ready to begin implementation through the office that now administers the divorce education class for parents.<br /><br />I would like people to know about this legislation so that they can introduce something similar in their state. I appreciate all that you do for marriage and families in this country.<br /><br />Copy and paste this URL into your browser and you will have several options<br />to retrieve the text or even listen to committee and floor debates:   <a href="http://le.utah.gov/%7E2007/htmdoc/hbillhtm/HB0128S01.htm"><br />http://le.utah.gov/~2007/htmdoc/hbillhtm/HB0128S01.htm</a><br /><br />Lorie D.

Economist nails the problem with divorce</a></span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>"I hear from young people who would love to get married and stay married because they don’t want to put their own children through the misery of divorce that they endured. But these young people are frightened, and not confident about their ability to sustain married life.<br /><br />I hear from women whose husbands abandoned them and their children, for no particular reason. The law in most states does not protect the partner who wants to stay married, but the one who wants divorce. ... Marriage is the most basic form of social cooperation. It is the institution in which children are born and reared. When spousal cooperation breaks down, the substitutes for it are intrusive, ineffective, and expensive. ... We owe the young better than this.

NJ faster divorce bill: bad idea</span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The AP reports:<br />----<br />N.J. Senate acts to speed up the divorce process<br /><br />New Jersey couples who cite "irreconcilable differences" would be able to get divorced in six months under a bill passed in the Senate yesterday.<br />State law requires couples to wait 18 months. The bill, approved 30-5, has been considered by an Assembly committee but not the full Assembly. It was supported by the New Jersey Bar Association and opposed by the New Jersey Catholic Conference. - AP--<br /><br />Posted 12/5/06 at<br /><a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/new_jersey/16166188.htm">http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/new_jersey/16166188.htm</a><br />-----<br /><br />This is a bad idea. New Jersey is currently tied for the 9th-lowest divorce rate in the U.S. (according to 2004 divorce rates). Its current law requires an 18-month wait for no-fault divorce when only one spouse wants the divorce. Americans for Divorce Reform's research consistently shows very low divorce rates in states, like New Jersey, that have long divorce waiting periods that are shortened when both spouses consent to the divorce.<br /><br />--  John Crouch<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Hunch Unravels Immigrant Wedding Scam</a></span>

What's Indiana's divorce rate? Nobody knows</a></span>

Nobody knows</a>:<br /><br />AP<br /><br />September 11, 2006 (FORT WAYNE, Ind.) - Activists and elected officials sometimes cite Indiana's divorce rate as proof that the institution of marriage needs protection, but no one really knows what that rate is.<br /><br />Indiana is one of five states that don't track divorce statistics.<br /><br />But not knowing the divorce rate doesn't stop lobbyists from pushing the state to take steps to lower it. State Representative Robert Kuzman, a Crown Point Democrat, notes that several covenant marriage bills have been filed over the years with the purpose of reducing divorce, even thoudh no one knows what the divorce rate is.<br /><br />The Legislative Services Agency, the research arm of the General Assembly, has been unable to find any official divorce rates for Indiana.<br /><br />Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma says a 50 percent divorce rate often is cited in testimony on bills before the General Assembly. He says it's a statistic the state should track.<br /><br />(Copyright 2006 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)"<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

What's the worst that could happen in a divorce?</a></span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div><a title="ABC News: Divorce Wars" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2211344&page=1">ABC News has a fun and comprehensive story called "Divorce Wars</a>" (7/20/06) documenting the crazy, hateful things people do to each other in divorces. It may be short on redeeming "social and political import" but as a divorce lawyer and critic I liked it a lot. Fun quotes from it:<br /><p>Raoul Felder says: "the wife and daughter are going to end up with the entire proceeds of this house that is going to be worth much more because he blew it up."<br /> </p>   <p>"It's easy to forget divorce usually begins because at least one party thinks it will solve his or her problems. As writer Dorothy Dix once noted, 'Many people think divorce is a panacea for every ill. … They find out, when they try it, that the remedy is worse than the disease.'" </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Family & Legal Scholars Criticize ALI's "Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution"</span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Reconceiving the Family: Critique of the American Law Institute's Principles<br />of the Law of Family Dissolution<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521861195/sr=8-1/qid=1153584369/ref=sr_1_1/103-3348794-1891006?ie=UTF8">Available on amazon.com</a><br /><br />Just released, July 17, 2006.<br /><br />The American Law Institute's (ALI) "Principles of the Law of Family<br />Dissolution" is "arguably the most sweeping proposal for family law reform<br />attempted in the U.S. over the last quarter century." In "Reconceiving the<br />Family" a group of 27 top law scholars of left and right challenge and<br />critique various aspects; from ALI's call to eliminate every last vestige of<br />fault (or morality) from family law, to its call to treat cohabiting couples<br />the same as married couples to (in what the editor calls "unearned trust")<br />the attempt to transfer parental rights to so-called defacto parents. This<br />is a must read for anyone interested in policy, legal, or moral debates over<br />marriage and family law. It's a Cambridge University Press book and<br />expensive, but worth it.<br /><br />(copied from SmartMarriages.com)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Reconciliation procedures in divorce court are too little, too late</a></span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=13339">This article from the Malaysian newspaper "Sun to Surf"</a> observes some of the same things that I and others have been saying about marriage reconcilation procedures in American state divorce laws -- they begin too late in the divorce process to save marriages, and the people administering them do not take them seriously. (Half the states of the U.S. and many European countries have such laws -- ADR recently did <a href="http://www.divorcereform.org/compare.html">a study of them</a> and <a href="http://www.divorcereform.org/cpabstract.html">a proposal on how to improve them</a>.<br /><br />What it takes to save marriages<br />Maria J. Dass<br />13 Mar 2006<br /><br />http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=13339<br /><br />PETALING JAYA: Marriages heading into trouble need to be saved way before hitting the brink of divorce.<br /><br />As such, efforts to protect the sanctity of marriage as contained in the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976 may not be effective as most cases referred to the Marriage tribunal are already past the reconciliation stage.<br /><br />Help can only make a difference where a marriage has not reached the stage of divorce, but when one or both spouses file for divorce, this usually means that they have passed the stage of reconciliation, said Malaysian Consultative Council for Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity Harcharan Singh.<br /><br />In most cases, couples will issue a joint petition where they are not required to refer the matter to the marriage tribunal, he said when responding to questions on the effectiveness of the marriage tribunal in reconciling ailing marriages.<br /><br />However, if one party wants to work at the marriage, then it is referred to the tribunal where efforts will be made to reconcile them, failing which a certificate will be issued stating that all conciliatory efforts have failed, he said.<br /><br />The party which is asking for the divorce is not compelled to attend the hearing with counsellors, so efforts to patch things up are often futile, said Harcharan.<br /><br />Speaking of his experience in the Sentul Gudwara conciliatory board, he said: "In 24 years, only one couple came to us for help - and that too only one party, as the other was not willing to reconcile."<br /><br />Efforts to help couples going through a bad patch have been taken up by some temples and churches.<br /><br />The Catholic Church, for example, has a marriage encounter programme where couples who have been married for more than five years are encouraged to participate. It focuses on helping couples rediscover their relationship and mend tensions that have been building up over the years.<br /><br />theSun on March 13, 2006, front-paged a report that the marriage tribunals set up to counsel couples against divorce were a farce as of the 4,307 couples counselled last year, only 103 marriages (2.4%) were saved.<br /><br />This was because inexperienced counsellors issued certificates (so that divorce petitions can be heard in court) without seriously trying to reconcile them.<br /><br />On April 21, 2004 Justice Datuk V. T. Singham chided the Batu Gajah marriage tribunal in the High Court in Ipoh.<br /><br />The judge had said that instead of making serious attempts to save a marriage, the tribunal preferred to issue certificates stating that reconciliation was not possible.<br /><br />He said the tribunal took just 15 minutes to conclude its session.<br /><br />Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said if the allegations are true, it goes against what her ministry has been propogating.<br /><br />"I will study the matter and bring it up at the cabinet meeting."<br /><br />When the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act was enacted in 1976, the statute was intended to protect the sanctity of marriage.<br /><br />Thus, ensuring all means were taken before even proceeding with a divorce.<br /><br />Updated: 07:35PM Mon, 13 Mar 2006<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

De Facto Parenthood</a></span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/011/918sohds.asp">De Facto Parenthood: The reformers' latest unwholesome innovation in family law.<br />by Sara Butler Nardo<br />Weekly Standard 03/06/2006, Volume 011, Issue 24<br /></a><br />Mike Thompson of the Texas ADR chapter sent us this article by our friend Sara Butler Nardo of  the Instititute for American Values.<br /><br />This excerpt shows the frighteningly loose legal standard for declaring someone a "de facto parent". --<br /><br /> "The Washington court, following Wisconsin's model,<br />established a four-part test to be used by judges in determining whether a<br />person has standing as a de facto parent:<br />(1) the natural or legal parent consented to and fostered the parent-like<br />relationship; (2) the petitioner and the child lived together in the same<br />household; (3) the petitioner assumed obligations of parenthood without<br />expectation of financial compensation; and (4) the petitioner has been in<br />a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with<br />the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.<br /><br />"Rather than answering a simple question--Does the adult have a biological<br />or adoptive relationship to the child in question?--judges will award<br />parenthood depending on whether the relationship appears sufficiently<br />"parent-like," a notable expansion of state power in the realm of family<br />life.<br /><br />"The courts have justified the creation of de facto parenthood by arguing<br />it serves the best interests of children. In reality, however, it works at<br />cross-purposes to the institution that most essentially serves children's<br />interests--marriage. ... In reality, de facto parenthood serves adults more than children ... .<br /><br />"This new circular definition of parenthood--a parent is a person who<br />performs the function of a parent--is part of a larger trend in family law<br />that sees the law as the creator of the family ... the words we use to<br />describe this most vital social institution--family, mother, father,<br />marriage--do not correspond to natural relationships, but are mere labels<br />that the state is free to apply as it sees fit.<br /><br />"In the case of the label "marriage," the proposed change ... has been widely and loudly debated. The legal definition of "parent," meanwhile, is already quietly changing."<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Simpson breakup shows that to many, there's no truly no-fault divorce</span>

NY NOW leader opposes Unilateral Divorce in NY Times column</a></span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>February 19, 2006<br />Op-Ed: Divorce New York Style<br />By MARCIA PAPPAS<br /><br />Albany<br /><br />EARLIER this month, New York's Matrimonial Commission recommended that the<br />state allow unilateral no-fault divorces. This is a bad idea, and,<br />frankly, it's unnecessary.<br /><br />New York already has what is in effect a bilateral no-fault divorce law.<br />This means that if both spouses want out of the marriage, they can divorce<br />without any apparent reason after living separate and apart for one year<br />after signing a separation agreement. In fact, the vast majority of<br />divorce cases are settled without court intervention. These settlements,<br />termed separation agreements, then become the basis for the divorce<br />decree. The process, because it doesn't require much involvement by the<br />courts, is less expensive for both parties.<br /><br />The problem with unilateral no-fault divorce is that it hurts women by<br />removing the incentive for the moneyed spouse (who is usually the husband)<br />to make a settlement. Instead of negotiating with a dependent spouse ˜<br />whose only leverage for avoiding an impoverished post-divorce life for<br />herself and her children may be her assent, or lack of it, to divorce ˜<br />the husband can simply go to court and obtain an uncontested divorce. Even<br />if child custody and property division issues haven't been resolved, a<br />judge can grant a divorce for "good cause" if say, the husband's<br />girlfriend is pregnant.<br /><br />And here's where things get tricky. In these cases, resolution of child<br />custody and property division can drag on for years, to the detriment of<br />the abandoned poorer spouse. And because unilateral no-fault cuts down on<br />the incentive to settle cases by agreement, it can take a lot of money and<br />time in court to make such divorces final.<br /><br />For women, in general, having to go to court instead of being able to<br />negotiate a settlement is a misfortune ˜ especially in New York, where, as<br />the Office of Court Administration has repeatedly acknowledged, the court<br />system has a bias against women. Moreover, a settlement is also beneficial<br />for women because both parties can agree to terms that the court cannot<br />order. For example, in New York, the court can require child support until<br />the child is 21, but the parties can, and often do agree outside of court<br />to support payments until graduation from college.<br /><br />And there's no question that unilateral no-fault divorce hurts women's<br />economic well-being. A study in Connecticut conducted from 1977 to 1987,<br />showed that under unilateral no-fault divorce laws, fewer women ˜ only 37<br />percent ˜ were awarded the marital home as compared with 82 percent under<br />fault divorce. In 1970, California became the first state in America to<br />adopt unilateral no-fault laws. These laws have had a devastating impact<br />on the women in that state. For instance, in San Diego, the likelihood of<br />a woman receiving alimony awards went to 30 percent in 1976 from 66<br />percent in 1968.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it appears that New York will move to institute unilateral<br />no-fault divorce. If this is inevitable then, at the very least, the state<br />Legislature needs to remedy the problems faced by poorer spouses in a<br />dispute by awarding them counsel and expert fees commensurate with the<br />fees being spent by the moneyed spouse. Such a mandate would go a long way<br />to level the playing field and ensure fairness for the non-moneyed spouse<br />in the court system. The Legislature also needs to establish fair and<br />equitable economic maintenance guidelines, just as the state now has child<br />support guidelines.<br /><br />Furthermore, in the case of custody disputes, the Legislature should<br />require that child custody be awarded to the parent who was the primary<br />caregiver during the marriage to ensure stability and continuity of care<br />for children.<br /><br />A primary caregiver presumption would also cut down on a litigation tool<br />in which one parent agrees to forgo a custody battle if the other parent<br />agrees to a less favorable financial settlement. Richard Neely, a lawyer<br />in West Virginia, has acknowledged that he often gave that advice to his<br />male clients. When he became chief justice of the West Virginia Supreme<br />Court of Appeals, he was responsible for the passage of a primary<br />caregiver law. Unfortunately, under pressure from fathers' rights groups,<br />West Virginia's Legislature has since revoked that presumption.<br /><br />New York is often mentioned as the only state in America without<br />unilateral no-fault divorce laws. But that doesn't mean that fault divorce<br />is bad. New York is the only state where the court has jurisdiction to<br />order child support to 21 ˜ and that's good. Sure, there are things about<br />New York's divorce laws that could be fixed, but a process that takes time<br />and weighs the various arguments is the only way to ensure fairness and<br />financial stability for everyone involved.<br /><br />Marcia Pappas is the president of New York's chapter of the National<br />Organization of Women.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

Statement on New York Divorce Reform</span>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Here's what I told a columnist about this today --<br /><br />New York has been affected by the nationwide culture of unilateral divorce, but its much tighter divorce law does help keep marriages from falling apart -- New York has one of the nation's lowest divorce rates. The current law also favors negotiation over unilateral action. That's a major reason why out-of-court "Collaborative Divorce" has been so successful in New York. <br /><br />If the Assembly wants to do something about ugly "fault" divorces and encourage collaborative divorces, they should do so directly, by switching the waiting periods around -- have a one-year waiting period before filing a "fault" divorce, and a much shorter waiting period for truly "mutual consent" divorces, where the couple has worked out an agreement on all the details, such as custody and finances.<br /><br />But that is very different from unilateral "irreconcilable differences" divorce, a tragic experiment the first time around, and a farce if it is repeated now. The Assembly should look carefully at the experience of the rest of the U.S., where the well-intended 1960s movement to replace fault with a more therapeutic, consensual process went tragically awry. Many states passed laws saying that before granting a divorce, judges should carefully examine whether the couple really had "irreconcilable differences", referring them to counseling whenever it might help. But these laws quickly broke down into mere "unilateral divorce", because judges did not have the time or training to implement them, so they decreed that filing for a divorce was proof of "irreconcilable differences".<br /><br />Nationwide, unilateral divorce has produced more divorces, longer divorces, and uglier divorces.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;
