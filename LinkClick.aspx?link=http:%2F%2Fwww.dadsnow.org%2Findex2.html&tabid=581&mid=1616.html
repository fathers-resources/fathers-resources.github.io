      us to look at the historic roots of radical feminism which contemporary 
      political correctness has blinded us to. Most folks alive today believe 
      that contemporary feminism just appeared out of nowhere in the 1950's or 
      1960's as a movement dedicated to obtaining "equal rights for women". This 
      is incorrect.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Radical 
      feminism's first organized incarnation was within the <B>Women's Ku Klux

      discrimination against blacks:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000><I>WKKK women 
      basically went around talking about what black men night do to them, and 
      white men preached of the sanctity of "white womanhood". The sexually 
      hypercharged imagery, together with economic desires of slave-owners, made 
      widespread violence and discrimination against blacks acceptable and even 
      necessary in the public eye. Women got what they wanted by motivating men 
      with horrid sexual imagery about blacks, and men took up their dirty 
      duties protecting the sanctity of "white womanhood". 
</I></FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Early WKKK 
      radical feminists also wrote about the drudgery of motherhood and other 
      typical feminist topics we read about frequently today. A common 
      overarching theme was women using their sexual power to get men to do 
      whatever they wanted – a theme identical to the core ideology of the 
      contemporary V-Day initiatieve pushed by N.O.W. in hopes of replacing 
      Valentine's Day with a murky celebration of misandry. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In the late 
      1880's, a broadside was published in Evansville, Indiana proclaiming; "No 
      longer will man say that in the hand of woman rests the necessity of 
      rocking a cradle only. She has within her hand the power to rule the 
      world." This, and many other early radical mottos would magically reappear 
      in the 1960's and find popularity in "great society" feminist revolution.

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The 
      similarities in core language and ideology between the WKKK and the modern 
      radical feminist movement over time are remarkable. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The WKKK was 
      also a major power base of the "Votes for Women" movement, although this 
      historical fact is of little interest in this analysis.</FONT></P>

      radical-feminist perspectives is essentially that motherhood is a laudable

      there is no husband in the picture (who is of course blamed for all of 
      society's problems).</FONT></FONT><FONT

      exception of a few egalitarian feminist thinkers, who hold somewhat more 
      balanced views (and are viciously attacked by radicals for it); mainstream 
      contemporary feminism is unquestionably founded in misandry.

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The WKKK had 
      over 4 million members by 1925, a substantial organization in those days. 
      In Indiana, an estimated 32% of white native-born women were members of 
      the WKKK.. Their work was largely promulgated through networks in the 
      Protestant Church, the Y.W.C.A., and a variety of "vice squad 
      organizations" which blamed all vice on men, but never questioned women's 
      part in it. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>By the 1920's, 
      a congressional investigation into the KKK concluded that a woman named 
      Elizabeth Tyler was the "true power" behind the KKK -- the grand dragon 
      serving as little more than a figurehead. Tyler had achieved controlling 
      power by catering to the weaknesses of men, and being the leading 
      fundraiser of the WKKK and even the KKK itself. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>After passage 
      of the 19th amendment, radical women no longer needed the Klan as a power

      believe us about feminism's substantial participation in discrimination 
      against blacks, via the use of sexual imagery; and the foundation it 
      formed for contemporary feminism, should read the book "Women of the Klan" 
      by Kathleen L. Blee. This book be purchased at <A

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>As part of her 
      summary about the WKKK movement Blee concluded, <I>"the WKKK [created] a 
      gender ideology that was neither fundamentally reactionary nor 
      progressive. Rather, the women's Klan was contradictory: a reactionary, 
      hate-base movement with progressive moments."</I> (Those who study the 
      agenda, activities, and methodology of contemporary radical feminism - 
      which traded hate of black men for hate of all men-- have little choice 
      but to come to a similar conclusion). </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>One book reviewer wrote this summary of Blee's book:<I> "The 
      significance of "Women of the Klan" rests not in its somewhat ebullient 
      celebration of feminist principles, but rather, that it documents in great 
      detail a direct lineage between the Women's Ku Klux Klan and the radical 
      feminist movement as it exists today. The book draws from a wide variety 
      of historical documents, letters, and in-camera interviews that the author 
      recorded with older women who were still alive at the time the book was 
      written."</I></FONT></P>

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Starting in 
      about 1930, radical feminists began studying Freudian psychology which was 
      eagerly being exported from Europe. They practiced and incorporated it 
      conveniently to eventually contrive professional credibility for ulterior 
      victim-feminist theories and goals. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Anna Freud was 
      a participant in this effort. In 1973, she callously wrote, <I>"The 
      noncustodial parent should have no legally enforceable right to visit the 
      child, and the custodial parent should have the right to decide whether it 
      is desirable for the child to have such visits."</I></FONT></FONT><I><FONT

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Freud's granddaughter, a retired Simmons 
      College professor of Psychology perhaps knows better than anybody 
      else&nbsp;what Freudian psychology was all about and the tremendous human 
      damage it has done.&nbsp; In her lecture<EM> False Prophets,</EM>&nbsp; 
      Sophie unequivocally stated, "Freud and Hitler shared a neighbourhood. 
      They also shared the ambition to convince other men of the one and only 
      truth that they had come upon - Sigmund Freud with brilliant rhetoric, 
      Adolf Hitler with brutal force. Adored by their followers, they founded 
      powerful movements. In my eyes both Adolf Hitler and my grandfather were 
      false prophets of the 20th century." [<EM>False Prophets</EM>; Adelphi

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>Despite substantial rejection of Freudian psychology in many areas 
      of psychology, feminist psychology and jursiprudence centers its work on 
      sexual innuendo, subjective observation, and a lack of hard data to create 
      the illusion that findings are professional findings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>The wide body of psychological science provides no support showing 
      that this is a good policy, yet courts do this regularly, police refuse to 
      enforce orders, and legislatures rarely provide legislation or funding to 
      enforce orders. We find it interesting that stealing a child from another 
      parent is not a crime, but stealing a Barbie doll from the toy store will 
      get you arrested.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The Freudian 
      science of discrimination is most easy seen in the style and mysterious 
      technique of conventional psychological "tea leaf readers" who testify for 
      a fee to "validate" child or spousal abuse despite a lack of statistical 
      testing. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>"Validation" is 
      the dishonest process of taking an allegation, then applying the anecdotal 
      evidence within the allegation itself to "prove" that abuse took place. 
      This method operates in defiance of the ridiculousness of the allegations 
      or strong fact to the contrary, and rarely incorporates statistical 
      measurement by having an M.M.P.I. done on all parties in the case. 
      </FONT><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>For example, in 
      one notorious St. Louis case, Dr. Montaleone of Cardinal Glennon Hospital

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Feminist 
      psychologists often "project" the behavior of the wife and/or children on 
      the husband, blaming him for their problems, usually without ever meeting

      studies and courts pretend that fathers are causing problems for women and 
      children when they try to save the marriage, litigate for fair custody 
      provisions or attempt to enforce visitation. The feminist perspective is 
      entirely incorrect, for it is the commonplace aggression of divorce, 
      denial of parenthood, and denial of constructive social position, which 
      brings on litigation by fathers who care.</FONT></FONT></P>

      consensus of studies from both "liberal" and "conservative" researchers 
      show that children in non-intact families have&nbsp;tremendously higher

      The stresses of divorce weigh heavily on everyone. </FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>If problems are 
      to be blamed on anyone, they must be blamed on those who seek divorce for 
      irresponsible reasons or those who truly deserved the divorces they were 
      served with. Unless one could reasonable conclude that 60% of America's 
      divorced men were cruel wife-beating child-abusing husbands, we cannot 
      blame these problems on husbands as we do today.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In the 1960's, 
      feminism arrived on center stage. Instead of using sexual imagery about 
      black men, they simply dropped the word "black" from their jargon. Men 
      were unfair and unjust. Marriage was a trap. Any self respecting man must 
      leave the human race to do whatever women wanted. And many of them 
      did.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><FONT 
      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Divorce rates 
      skyrocketed as demanded by anti-family radical feminist activists. Lawyers 
      controlling the political and legal system profiteered unimaginably by 
      replacing husbands with child support. All of society's problems were 
      blamed on men. Radical feminists applied a classic "fallacy of 
      composition" trick to the situation. Divorce drove men out of the house by 
      doing things behind closed doors. Suddenly, the husband was no longer in 
      the home. The appearance is that men ran out on the family, in large 
      numbers, when in fact the vast majority of them were thrown out of 
      it.</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>Even Paul McCartney, the President of Promise Keepers, blamed 
      family breakdown on men in a National Review article. This was a tragic 
      and fatal blow to the Promise Keepers movement, because most men know this 
      is false feminist imagery – and by the end of that year Promise Keepers 
      was nearly bankrupt due to the exodus of members.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>By the late 1980's, the debacle of the McMartin case weakened the 
      now-commonplace feminist family-courtroom trick of using wild allegations 
      of child abuse against men to control families and society. The 
      Carter-Mondale Act of 1974 had combined two bills, one automatically 
      funding child abuse treatment, with another bill designed to find out how 
      much child abuse there was out there. The combination of the two created a 
      self-financing endless search for child abuse under every rock, and 
      feminists played the system to the limit. All it took was one phone call, 
      no matter how absurd the allegation, to put the husband out of the home -- 
      never to return.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>In the 1990's, radicals switched to using false allegations of 
      domestic abuse. The political-correctness of misandry dictates that women 
      are always the victim (when in fact women initiate slightly more than half 
      of all serious physical spousal altercations). Between 1999 and 2003, 
      $4-billion in federal funds given to the National Organization of Women 
      under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), will have been spent 
      spreading hate of men in society and on college campuses and driving 
      husbands out of families.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>By 1988, most state laws (driven by federal pass-through 
      legislation) permitted seizure of home, family, bank accounts, and all 
      other substantial assets by women in one court ex-parte hearing, which the 
      husband is not permitted to attend. Even "live-in" girlfriends can steal 
      the ranch in this manner. Most judges don't have time to figure out 
      whether or not the allegations are true, and no judge wants to end up on 
      the front page of the newspaper because some woman got hurt, so most 
      judges approve these restraining orders without question. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>Unfortunately, the abuse of restraining orders causes far more 
      violence than it prevents. According to the National Family Violence 
      Surveys, less than 25% of serious altercations take place in the intact 
      family. The substantial majority of domestic violence takes place in the 
      broken family. The stresses of divorce cause tremendous friction between 
      spouses, particularly if one spouse is being abused by the courts. Public 
      policy makers would do far better by helping spouses work through the 
      normal processes of marriage and aging rather than throwing gasoline on 
      families.</FONT></P>

      N.O.W. found a solution for this problem. It realized that if it could 
      only legalize "female-female" marriage, that women could have what I call 
      "super-families". Under existing federal and state laws, a "Super-family" 
      would have six sources of income, comprised of two sets of welfare 
      entitlements, two sets of child support orders, and the incomes of the two 
      women. </FONT></FONT></P>

      realized that America would not go along easily with the idea of 
      "female-female" marriage. A victim-class was needed, and lesbians were the 
      perfect victims. Of the two states which have legalized female-female 
      marriage, none have a " sexual preference" requirement in order to 
      qualify. Any two women can marry each other – regardless of sexual 
      preference.</FONT></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>Segregation is precisely what lesbian political agenda is designed 
      to create. N.O.W. wants to segregate society along sexual lines, with 
      women having all social rights to marriage and family, while men can no 
      longer be a part of family or society. Their idea is for women to have a 
      couple of kids under any possible circumstance as the vehicle for walking 
      away from society, taking all their marbles, accumulating additional 
      social and economic rights at the expense of men, and get paid for doing 
      so.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>In this light, we begin to realize that "Heather has two mommies" 
      is really a supremacist sex power slogan, no different than the "white 
      power" slogans of the Ku Klux Klan. The difference between racist 
      segregation and sexual segregation is this: Racial segregation was 
      intended to be forced on blacks by not allowing them various social, 
      legal, and property rights. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>Because of the "divorce revolution" (which was forced on men by 
      feminists and hungry lawyers), sexual segregation already affects about 
      half the fathers in America, by revoking their natural parental rights 
      because government took away their children at the whim of some woman. We 
      see here that the deeply anti-family dreams of the 1960's would actually 
      come true if legislators are fooled into creating a sexually-segregated 
      society in the false name of "equality".</FONT></P>

      size=2>The oft-claimed right of "women's choice", is merely a cover for 
      widespread discrimination against men. The Civil War was fought because 
      Southerners defiantly claimed that it was their right to choose to do what 
      they wanted. Nobody has yet properly declared the war on feminism that is 
      long overdue. Feminists and corrupt lawyers should <I>not</I> have a right

            Phil Hartman was brutally murdered by his cocaine-abusing wife, who 
            then committed suicide. It was discovered that he had been 
            experiencing difficulties coping with her for some time. Despite all 
            his money, there was no legal structure in place for him to force 
            her into treatment, and little legal structure for him to seek 
            protection from her. </FONT></FONT></P>

            federal domestic violence laws were not sexist, Phil might be with 
            us today, and his wife might have a new start on life without 
            drugs.</FONT></FONT> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
